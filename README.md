# Power

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE MASTER** - If you are making an MLPerf submission, DO NOT use the master branch. See the appropriate release branch. 

This repo contains the development branch of MLPerf™ power measurement code. Everything is Apache 2.0 code developed by MLCommons™. Access is available to anyone.

MLPerf™ is using [SPEC PTDaemon] tool for measuring power. Please see [this](https://github.com/mlcommons/power-dev/tree/master/ptd_client_server) README for more details on how to use it. 

[This tutorial](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/tutorials/mlperf-inference-power-measurement.md) demonstrates how to do a power measurement setup and do MLPerf™ Inference benchmarking with power measurements using [MLCommons CK2/CM framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck).
